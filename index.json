Our algorithm, SimPLE, achieved state-of-the-art performance on standard SSL benchmarks and achieved the best accuracy on some tasks in LwLL evaluation. We also evaluated our method in the transfer setting where our algorithm outperforms prior works and supervised baseline by a large margin.\nThe following project description is taken from DARPA.\n In supervised machine learning (ML), the ML system learns by example to recognize things, such as objects in images or speech. Humans provide these examples to ML systems during their training in the form of labeled data. With enough labeled data, we can generally build accurate pattern recognition models.\nThe problem is that training accurate models currently requires lots of labeled data. For tasks like machine translation, speech recognition or object recognition, deep neural networks (DNNs) have emerged as the state of the art, due to the superior accuracy they can achieve. To gain this advantage over other techniques, however, DNN models need more data, typically requiring 109 or 1010 labeled training examples to achieve good performance.\nThe commercial world has harvested and created large sets of labeled data for training models. These datasets are often created via crowdsourcing: a cheap and efficient way to create labeled data. Unfortunately, crowdsourcing techniques are often not possible for proprietary or sensitive data. Creating data sets for these sorts of problems can result in 100x higher costs and 50x longer time to label.\nTo make matters worse, machine learning models are brittle, in that their performance can degrade severely with small changes in their operating environment. For instance, the performance of computer vision systems degrades when data is collected from a new sensor and new collection viewpoints. Similarly, dialog and text understanding systems are very sensitive to changes in formality and register. As a result, additional labels are needed after initial training to adapt these models to new environments and data collection conditions. For many problems, the labeled data required to adapt models to new environments approaches the amount required to train a new model from scratch.\nThe Learning with Less Labeling (LwLL) program aims to make the process of training machine learning models more efficient by reducing the amount of labeled data required to build a model by six or more orders of magnitude, and by reducing the amount of data needed to adapt models to new environments to tens to hundreds of labeled examples.\n LwLL Evaluation The evaluation has 3 types of tasks: NLP, Image Classification and Object Detection. Our team is focusing on the image classification task. Each task includes a base stage and an adaptation stage where each stage consists of 6 to 7 checkpoints. For image classification, pre-trained models on some selected datasets are allowed.\nAt the first checkpoint, only 1 label per category is available. As the training progress, more class labels become available until the training is fully labeled in the last checkpoint.\nDevelopment Detail Our team used a few-shot learning method for the first 2 to 3 checkpoints when the labeled set size is small. Once sufficient number of labeled data samples become available, the training was handed to our semi-supervised algorithm.\n Designed a novel algorithm for semi-supervised classification Evaluated our algorithm on standard benchmarks (CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, SVHN, Mini-ImageNet) Evaluated our algorithm in the transfer learning setting (on Mini-ImageNet, DomainNet-Real, AID, RESISC45), where models are initialized models pretrained on ImageNet or DomainNet-Real Distributed training with PyTorch Distributed Data Parallel GPU accelerated data augmentation with Kornia  Related Publications  Zijian Hu, Zhengyu Yang, Xuefeng Hu, Ram Nevatia  (2021).

The NAO robot, acting as a group moderator, was positioned towards the participants. On the table, a 360-degree microphone and 3 cameras facing directly to the participants' face were placed. Behind the robot, an RGB-D camera was mounted on a tripod to record the interactions between the group members.

Increasing practical constraints lead this data integration difficult or impossible, including data privacy and confidentiality, intellectual property protection, and law constraints. A promising solution to these problems is called Federated Learning [McMahan et al., 2016]. As shown in Figure 1(b), Federated Learning enables collaboratively training on edge devices or edge data centers through exchanging parameters or gradients without centralizing their scattered data (In this work, we use both worker and node to represent edge devices or edge data centers). Representative examples happen in various domains such as Mobile Internet, health, and finance domains [McMahan and Ramage, 2017, Liu et al., 2018a, Liu et al., 2018b].\n Federated Multi-Task Learning Topology. (a) Cloud-Based Distributed Learning; (b) Centralized Federated Learning; (c) Decentralized Federated Learning; (d) Centralized Communication Topology with Decentralized Parameter Exchanging Topology.   Problem formulation Statistical Challenges  Non-IID: Each worker generates data in a non-i.i.d. (independent and identically distributed) manner with a distinct statistical distribution. Unbalanced Local Data: Workers have different quantity of data sample due to their different behaviors.  These two characteristics bring challenges to learning a high-performance personalized model for each worker.\nSystem Challenges  Larger Worker Number: The worker number is typically larger than cloudbased learning. The larger number will pose a higher communication cost and difficult communication synchronization. Heterogeneous Networks: Each worker may differ in communication capacity due to heterogeneous networks(4G, WiFi, and other IoT protocol). Heterogeneous Computation: Computational capacities of each worker may differ due to variability in hardware(CPU, memory).  These three characteristics make communication cost and low-speed training become a major bottleneck towards real-world deployment.\nIn practice, scattered data owners also demand personalized models rather than a global model for all owners. They hope to not only get help from other owners’ data to train a high accuracy model but also to gain their personalized models which can represent their unique data properties. Thus, to simultaneously address statistical and system challenges is the primary research direction of federated learning.\n Figure 2: Federated Multi-Task Deep Learning Framework   General Definition of Federated Learning Following the first federated learning paper McMahan et al. [2016], we define the objective function for the federated setting as\n$$ \\begin{aligned} F(\\mathbf{w}) \u0026amp;= \\sum_{k=1}^{K} \\frac{n_k}{N} F_{k}(\\mathbf{w}) \\\\\n\u0026amp;= \\sum_{k=1}^{K} \\frac{n_k}{N} \\frac{1}{n_k} \\sum_{i \\in \\mathcal{P}_{k}} l(\\mathbf{x}_{i}, \\mathbf{y}_{i}; \\mathbf{w}) \\end{aligned} $$\nwhere $ l(\\mathbf{x}_{i}, \\mathbf{y}_{i}; \\mathbf{w}) $ is the loss function of the prediction on example $(\\mathbf{x}_{i}, \\mathbf{y}_{i})$ made with model parameters $\\mathbf{w}$, K is the total learning nodes number, $\\mathcal{P}_{k}$ is the set of indexes of data points on node k, $n_k = |P_k|$, and $\\sum_{k=1}^{K} n_{k} = N$. This objective function can capture the different quantity of samples and statistical distribution of K nodes. Here, different nodes learn the global model jointly, which showing as the same loss function $l$ and parameters $\\mathbf{w}$.\nGeneral Framework of Federated Multi-Task Learning As mentioned in the introduction, federated multi-task learning is a framework that can improve the performance by directly capturing the relationships among unbalanced data in multiple devices, which implies that it can address the statistical challenges in federated learning. The general formulation for federated multi-task learning is:\n$$ \\min_{\\mathbf{W}}\\sum_{k=1}^{K}\\frac{1}{n_k}\\sum_{i=1}^{n_k}l_i(\\mathbf{x}_i,\\mathbf{y}_i;\\mathbf{w}_k) + \\mathcal{R}(\\mathbf{W},\\mathbf{\\Omega}). $$\nwhere $\\mathbf{W} = (\\mathbf{w}_1,\\mathbf{w}_2,\u0026hellip;,\\mathbf{w}_K) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d \\times{m}}$ is the parameters for different tasks and $\\mathcal{R}(\\mathbf{W},\\mathbf{\\Omega})$ is the regularization. Different multi-task framework is mainly different from the regularization term $\\mathcal{R}$.\nThe first term of the objective models the summation of different empirical loss of each node. The second term serves as a task-relationship regularizer with $\\mathbf{\\Omega}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{K\\times{K}}$ being the covariance matrix Zhang and Yeung [2012].\nThe covariance matrix is able to describe positive, negative and unrelated correlation between nodes, which can either known as priori or being measured while learning the models simultaneously.\nEach element $\\mathbf{\\Omega}_{i,j}$ is a value that indicates the similarity between two nodes. Here we use a bio-convex formulation in Zhang and Yeung [2012], which is a general case for other regularization methods,\n$$ \\mathcal{R}(\\mathbf{W},\\mathbf{\\Omega}) = \\lambda_ 1tr(\\mathbf{W}\\mathbf{\\Omega}^{-1}\\mathbf{W}^{T}) + \\lambda_2||\\mathbf{W}||_F^2. $$\nwhere we constrain $\\vec{W}$ with covariance matrix $\\mathbf{\\Omega}^{-1}$ through matrix trace $tr(\\mathbf{W}\\mathbf{\\Omega}^{-1}\\mathbf{W}^{T})$. This means the closer $\\mathbf{w}_i$ and $\\mathbf{w}_j$ is, the larger the $\\mathbf{\\Omega}_{i,j}$ will be. Specifically if $\\mathbf{\\Omega}$ is an identity matrix, then each node is independent to each other. Smith et al. [2017] proposed MOCHA based on the above multi-task learning framework. However, MOCHA can only handle convex functions in federated multi-task learning settings, which can not be generated to non-convex deep learning models. Our work generates federated multi-task learning framework to the non-convex DNN setting.\nFederated Multi-Task Deep Learning Framework DNNs are able to extract deep features from raw data. However, to the best of our knowledge, DNNs has not been applied to federated multi-task problems. We thus consider DNNs as our feature transformation function and make prediction based on the hidden features. Formally speaking, the formulation can be defined as:\n$$ \\begin{aligned} \u0026amp; \\begin{aligned} \\min_{\\mathbf{\\theta}, \\vec{U},\\vec{W},\\mathbf{\\Omega}} \u0026amp;\\sum_{k=1}^{K}\\frac{1}{n_k}\\bigg[\\bigg.\\sum_{i=1}^{n_k}l(f(\\vec{x}_i^{k},\\mathbf{\\theta}_k,\\vec{U}_k,\\vec{w}_k),\\vec{y}_i^k) \\\\\n\u0026amp;+ \\frac{1}{2}\\lambda_ 1tr(\\vec{W}_k\\mathbf{\\Omega}_k^{-1}\\vec{W}_k^{T})\\bigg]\\bigg. + \\frac{1}{2}\\lambda_2||\\vec{W}||_F^2\\\\\n\u0026amp;+\\frac{1}{2}\\lambda_3||\\mathbf{\\theta}||_F^2 + \\frac{1}{2}\\lambda_4||\\vec{U}||_F^2, \\end{aligned} \\\\\n\u0026amp; \\quad \\text{s.t.} \\quad \\mathbf{\\Omega}_k \\ge 0 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad tr(\\mathbf{\\Omega}_k) = 1, \\quad k = 1, 2, \u0026hellip; ,K. \\end{aligned} $$\nwhere $f(\\cdot)$ represents DNNs feature mapping as shown in Figure 2(b). $\\mathbf{\\theta}_k$ is the feature transformation network. $\\mathbf{U}_k$ and $\\vec{w}_k$ are output layer (e.g. softmax). The first constraint holds due to the fact that $\\mathbf{\\Omega}$ is defined as a task covariance matrix. The second constraint is used to restrict its complexity.\nIn federated learning situation, training should be conducted on each node respectively. One intuitive thought is the centralized network topology in McMahan et al. [2016], where one center node synchronously takes a weighted average parameters of every clients at each time step (Figure 2(a)). However, this model faces the problems that in DNNs situation, far more parameters need to be calculated and transferred. Each node has heterogeneous computing performance and network bandwidth (Figure (b)). Setting one center node to synchronously collect all the parameters will induce high communication cost and low convergence speed. In order to overcome these problems, we design a decentralized topology, where each node only needs to share their parameters with neighbored nodes as shown in Figure 2(c)), where there is no communication between worker one and worker 4. Abandoning the central node induces the problem that parameters cannot be exchanged and synchronized amongst every nodes, which means that the centralized optimization method can not be achieved on this topology. To this end, we propose a Decentralized Periodic Averaging SGD (DPA-SGD) to tackle the optimization problem in decentralized topology.\n Approach Decentralized Periodic Averaging SGD As for decentralized topology, due to the disappearing of central node, same central averaging method can not be applied. In order to overcome this problem, we come up with a novel optimization method, Decentralized Periodic Averaging SGD (DPA-SGD). The main idea of DPA-SGD is that during the communication period $\\tau$, local SGD is applied on each node respectively, and synchronizing all the parameters at every $\\tau$ iterations amongst its connected neighbors. Due to this decentralized diverse connection, one global $\\mathbf{\\Omega}$ can not represent the individual correlation. So we propose to use a distinct covariance matrix $\\mathbf{\\Omega}_k$ to represent their own mutual relationship. We also come up with an effective way to update the different $\\mathbf{\\Omega}_k$. To be specific, consider one particular node $m$ and its neighbor connected nodes as set $\\mathcal{M}$.\nThe new objective function can be defined as:\n$$ \\begin{aligned} \u0026amp; \\begin{aligned} \\min_{\\mathbf{\\theta}, \\vec{U},\\vec{W},\\mathbf{\\Omega}} \u0026amp;\\sum_{k=1}^{K}\\frac{1}{n_k}\\bigg[\\bigg.\\sum_{i=1}^{n_k}l(f(\\vec{x}_i^{k},\\mathbf{\\theta}_k,\\vec{U}_k,\\vec{w}_k),\\vec{y}_i^k) \\\\\n\u0026amp;+ \\frac{1}{2}\\lambda_ 1tr(\\vec{W}_k\\mathbf{\\Omega}_k^{-1}\\vec{W}_k^{T})\\bigg]\\bigg. + \\frac{1}{2}\\lambda_2||\\vec{W}||_F^2\\\\\n\u0026amp;+\\frac{1}{2}\\lambda_3||\\mathbf{\\theta}||_F^2 + \\frac{1}{2}\\lambda_4||\\vec{U}||_F^2, \\end{aligned} \\\\\n\u0026amp; \\quad \\text{s.t.} \\quad \\mathbf{\\Omega}_k \\ge 0 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad tr(\\mathbf{\\Omega}_k) = 1, \\quad k = 1, 2, \u0026hellip; ,K. \\end{aligned} $$\nwhere $\\vec{W}_k = (\\vec{w}_1,\\vec{w}_2,\u0026hellip;,\\vec{w}_m,\u0026hellip;\\vec{w}_{|\\mathcal{M}|})\\in\\mathbb{R}^{d\\times|\\mathcal{M}|}$ is the parameters for $m$ and its neighbor tasks. The matrix $\\mathbf{\\Omega}_k\\in\\mathbb{R}^{|\\mathcal{M}|\\times{|\\mathcal{M}|}}$ represents the correlation amongst nodes in set $\\mathcal{M}$. Here in order to record the entire nodes connection in the network, we introduce a node connection matrix $\\vec{M}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{K\\times{K}}$ represents the neighbor relationships for each nodes, where $M_{i, j}$ is a value that indicates node $i$ and $j$ are connected as shown in Figure 3, where worker one is only connected with worker two and four. Note that, if $\\vec{M} = \\vec{I}$ (Identity matrix), then every nodes are independent and update the parameters respectively. If $\\vec{M} = \\vec{J}$ (one for each element), the model is degenerated into centralized model. We study the model performance under sparse matrix $\\vec{M}$ and find that similar results can be achieved as a ring network topology, which each node is only connected with its nearby two nodes, as illustrated in Figure 3.\n Decentralized Periodic Averaging SGD   To solve this non-convex problem, we apply the alternating optimization method Zhang and Yeung [2012], where alternately updating parameters $\\vec{X} = (\\vec{W, U},\\mathbf{\\theta})$ and $\\mathbf{\\Omega}$.\nOptimizing $\\mathbf{\\theta}, \\vec{W}$ and $\\vec{U}$: For simplicity, we define set $\\Xi = (\\mathbf{\\Omega}_1, \\mathbf{\\Omega}_2,\u0026hellip;,\\mathbf{\\Omega_K})$ to represent the correlation matrix for every nodes. Fixing $\\Xi$, we can use SGD method to update $\\mathbf{\\theta}, \\vec{W}$ and $\\vec{U}$ jointly. Our problem can then be reformulated as:\n$$ \\begin{aligned} G(\\vec{W}, \\vec{U}, \\mathbf{\\theta}|\\Xi) \u0026amp;= \\sum_{k=1}^{K}\\frac{1}{n_k} \\bigg[\\bigg. \\sum_{i=1}^{n_k}l(f(\\textbf{x}_i^{k},\\mathbf{\\theta}_k,\\textbf{U}_k,\\textbf{w}_k),\\textbf{y}_i^k) \\\\\n\u0026amp; + \\frac{1}{2} \\lambda_1tr(\\textbf{W}_k\\mathbf{\\Omega}_k^{-1}\\textbf{W}_k^{T}) \\bigg]\\bigg. + \\frac{1}{2}\\lambda_2||\\textbf{W}||_F^2 \\\\\n\u0026amp;+ \\frac{1}{2}\\lambda_3||\\mathbf{\\theta}||_F^2 + \\frac{1}{2}\\lambda_4||\\textbf{U}||_F^2 \\end{aligned} $$\nWe can calculate the gradient of $\\vec{W}$, $\\vec{U}$ and $\\mathbf{\\theta}$ respectively. Let $L = \\sum_{k=1}^{K}\\frac{1}{n_k}\\sum_{i=1}^{n_k}l(f(\\mathbf{x}_i^{k}, \\mathbf{\\theta}_k,\\mathbf{u}_k,\\mathbf{w}_k),\\mathbf{y}_i^k)$. Then the gradient formulations for each node are:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial{G(\\vec{W}, \\vec{U}, \\mathbf{\\theta}|\\Xi)}}{\\partial{\\vec{w}_k}} = \\frac{\\partial{L}}{\\partial{\\vec{w}_k}} + \\lambda_1\\sum_{i=1}^{\\mathcal{|M|}} \\frac{1}{n_i}{\\vec{w}_k}\\mathbf{\\Omega}_i^{-1} + \\lambda_2\\vec{w}_k $$\nwhere the summation is amongst all the nodes connected to node $k$,\n$$ \\frac{\\partial{G(\\vec{W}, \\vec{U}, \\mathbf{\\theta}|\\Xi)}}{\\partial \\mathbf{\\theta}_k} = \\frac{\\partial{L}}{\\partial\\mathbf{\\theta}_k} + \\lambda_3\\mathbf{\\theta}_k, $$\n$$ \\frac{\\partial{G(\\vec{W}, \\vec{U}, \\mathbf{\\theta}|\\Xi)}}{\\partial{\\vec{u}_k}} = \\frac{\\partial{L}}{\\partial{\\vec{u}_k}} + \\lambda_4\\vec{u}_k $$\nOptimizing $\\Xi$: In paper Zhang and Yeung [2012], an analytical solution form is given for $\\mathbf{\\Omega}$:\n$$ \\mathbf{\\Omega} = \\frac{(\\vec{W}^T\\vec{W})^\\frac{1}{2}}{tr((\\vec{W}^T\\vec{W})^{\\frac{1}{2}})} $$\nApparently, if $\\mathbf{w}_i$ and $\\mathbf{w}_j$ are close to each other, $\\mathbf{\\Omega}$ will be large. However, the missing central node forbidding to average parameters globally. So here we propose a novel way to update each $\\mathbf{\\Omega}_k\\in\\Xi$:\n$$ \\mathbf{\\Omega}_{t+1}^{(k)} \\leftarrow \\eta\\frac{1}{|\\mathcal{M}|}({\\sum_{i=1}^{|\\mathcal{M}|}}\\frac{1}{n_i}\\mathbf{\\Omega}_{t}^{(i)} + \\frac{(\\vec{W}_k^T\\vec{W}_k)^\\frac{1}{2}}{tr((\\vec{W}_k^T\\vec{W}_k)^{\\frac{1}{2}})}) $$\nThe first averaging term can incorporate the nearby nodes correlation into its own and the second term captures the new correlation between its neighbors as shown in Figure 3.\nAlgorithm In general, the algorithm of DPA-SGD can be summarized as: while in local update period, each node calculates the gradient $g(\\vec{X}_t^{(i)})$ based on one mini-batch of data and then update $\\vec{X}^{(i)}$; For every synchronization per $\\tau$ update, the novel update way of $\\mathbf{\\Omega}$ is conducted.\n  Algorithm 1: Federated Multi-Task Deep Learning Framework with Decentralized Averaging SGD   Advantages of Our Algorithm Here we illustrate system-wise advantages of DPA-SGD:\n Illustration of training time reducing due to the mechanism of DPA-SGD   Faster convergence speed. Figure 4 illustrates three reasons that DHA-SGD can speed up convergence.\n Periodic averaging can alleviate the communication delay by reducing times of synchronization which only happen periodically. As we can see in Figure 4, the yellow blocks (communication) will largely be deleted due to the periodic averaging mechanism. This idle time can also be significantly reduced through periodic averaging as shown in Figure 4. In the decentralized topology, because a worker only needs to exchange gradients with its neighbors, another worker with slow computation and communication will not interrupt its iteration. For example, worker 2 in the above figure can synchronize earlier without waiting for worker 4. Thus, DHA-SGD can largely reduce convergence time.  Fewer communication rounds. The periodic averaging strategy can reduce the number of communication rounds. Although our work focuses on optimizing the ratio of computation and communication rather than improving the communication cost for each iteration, gradient compression method (Deep Gradient Compression [Lin et al., 2017]) for each iteration can directly extendable to to our algorithm in a practical system.\nSystem Design  Federated Learning System Design and Protocol   We have developed a real-world decentralized federated learning system. Our system is currently deployed in a cluster environment, consisting of 24 physical machines, each supporting 48 CPU cores. Suppose we run one process per CPU core, this system can run up to 1152 workers for parallel training. Our federated learning system enables centralized and decentralization training while supporting the Federated multi-task learning framework. It also supports user and training management in the Federated Learning scenario. As shown in Figure 5 (Upper), it includes training process management such as topology generation, user selection, configuration dispatching, on-device training, and statistics collection. In the topological generation step, we can select the appropriate eigenvalues for the topology matrix according to our the convergence property analysis, which determines the sparseness of the network topology to balance the model accuracy and the training speed. The user selection process can configure different strategies to select distinct users. Each user only requires training once for a model. In our experiment, users are selected according to the LEAF data set. This process can be further optimized in the future to choose users who are more meaningful to the model.\nThe software architecture of each worker is shown in Figure 5 (Lower). Each work can be an IoT device, smartphone or the edge server. It is an abstract architecture design for the on-device software system which unifies the system architecture for different on-device operating systems such as Android or iOS for the smartphone and the linux edge server. For the edge server, we implement this system design in a Python environment. For the smartphone, we develop the training worker system based on Android and iOS. The low-level communication is an abstract layer. In the edge server environment, we use the MPI protocol for exchanging gradient or other necessary information. As we can see, the communication sending and receiving threads are independent of the training threads. The collaborate through message queues. Currently, we only disclose the implementation of the MPI communication protocol in the source code. In the future, we consider open source our code to support more on-device platforms.\nTo put it simply, another contribution of this paper is that we publish a practical federated learning system that can promote further research on distributed learning and especially federated learning.\nComparison to Previous Works Federated Multi-Task Learning Early examples of research into federated learning. To address both statistical and system challenges, [Smith et al., 2017] and [Caldas et al. 2018] propose a multi-task learning framework for federated learning and its related optimization algorithm, which extends early works from distributed machine learning, including SDCAShalev-Shwartz and Zhang [2013]; Yang [2013]; Yang et al. [2013] and COCOAJaggi et al. [2014]; Ma et al. [2015]; Smith et al. [2016]. The main limitation of Smith et al. [2017] and Caldas et al. [2018], however, is that strong duality is only guaranteed when the objective function is convex, which can not be generalized to the non-convex setting, especially deep neural networks.\nAnother line of work related to federated multi-task learning is the cloud-based distributed multi-task learning [Ahmed et al., 2014; Jin et al., 2015; Mateos-Núñez et al., 2015; Wang et al., 2016; Baytas et al., 2016; Liu et al., 2017]. However, their assumption that the same amount of work is done locally on each node is prohibitive in federated settings, and none of these works take into account the systems challenges that arise in the federated setting.\nIn our work, we focus on training the deep learning model in the federated setting. To be more specific, in this work we further extend previous works to a generic multi-task deep learning framework and a more efficient optimization method. Different from previous works, we propose a decentralized approach for federated learning.\nStochastic Gradient Decent Optimization In large scale distributed deep learning, to address the communication bottleneck, synchronized mini-batch SGD, which increase the computation to communication ratio, is widely used in the parameter server framework [Dean et al.; Li et al., 2014; Cui et al., 2014] and popular deep learning systems such as Tensorflow [Abadi et al., 2016] and PyTorch [Paszke et al., 2017].\nCompared to this synchronized mini-batch SGD, Federated Averaging(FedAvg) SGD [Koneˇcný et al., 2016] in the federated setting empirically shows it has less communication rounds and it is also robust to non-IID data, which is now the state-of-the-art SGD algorithm for federated learning.\nDecentralized SGD, another approach to reducing communication, was successfully applied to deep learning [Jin et al., 2016; Jiang et al., 2017; Lian et al., 2017]. Instead of synchronizing with all workers, a worker in the decentralized SGD framework only needs to exchange gradient with its neighbors. Therefore, this sparse-connected topology can reduce the overall communication per iteration.\nOur work aims to design a novel SGD algorithm for our multi-task deep learning framework, which can leverage the advantages of periodic averaging SGD and decentralized SGD. We called it as Decentralized Periodic Averaging SGD. Although recent work [Wang and Joshi, 2018] has this idea preliminarily, it does not provide adequate theoretical analysis and empirical evaluation in the federated setting.\nResults DatasetNumber of devicesTotal samplesSample per devicemeanstdevFEMNIST3,550805,263226.8388.94Sent140660,1201, 600, 4982.424.71Shakespeare2,288106, 12646.3891.71 This table is a brief statistic of the dataset (LEAF) that we are using in the experiments.

Sent140 is a text dataset, which allows you to discover the sentiment of a brand or product. Shakespeare is also a text dataset, however the objective here is try to learn the pattern of the sentences and generate similar text style.\n  Accuracy for FedAvg Single-task and Ring DPA-SGD Multi-task vs Round number   We compare the performance between FedAvg, the current state-of-the-art Federated Learning algorithm, and our DPA-SGD on Multi-Task Learning Framework (DPA-SGD-MTL) with a ring topology network. From the Figure, we clearly see that the training speed is around 20% faster than the FedAvg. The Ring DPA-SGD-MTL’s accuracy is also comparable to the FedAvg.\n           Accuracy for FedAvg-MTL and DPA-SGD MTL vs walk clock time      Accuracy for FedAvg-MTL and DPA-SGD MTL vs round number       We also compared the performance between FedAvg on Multi-Task Learning Framework (FedAvg-MTL) and our DPA-SGD on Multi-Task Learning Framework (Ring DPA-SGD-MTL) with a ring topology network. From the Figure, we clearly see that the training speed is around 20% faster than the FedAvg-MTL. The Ring DPA-SGD-MTL’s accuracy is slightly lower but comparable than the FedAvg-MTL . This proves that our convergence analysis that when decentralized the topology of the gradient exchanging, due to the sparsity of the topology has a negative impact on the convergence of the model. We have to balance the performance of the model and the training speed in the federated learning setting.\nWe will conduct more experiment on model performance and training speed on communication and computation heterogeneous setting (delay = 0ms, 300ms, 1s, 3s), different number of works (4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512), and different topologies (0.3, 0.6, 0.9). Hopefully, we can finish these experiments before the NeurIPS deadline.\nAppendix Appendix I: Convergence Analysis Convergence of DPA-SGD: If the communication period $\\tau$ satisfies:\n$$ T \\geq K^{3} \\left( \\frac{1+\\zeta^{2}}{1-\\zeta^{2}} \\tau - 1 \\right)^{2} $$\nthen with learning rate $\\eta = \\frac{K}{LK} \\sqrt{\\frac{K}{T}}$ , the average-squared gradient norm after K iterations is bounded by\n$$ \\mathbb{E} \\Bigg[ \\frac{1}{T} \\sum\\limits_{t=1}^T {\\left\\lVert \\nabla F(\\vec u_{t}) \\right\\rVert}^{2} \\Bigg] \\leq \\frac{2[F(\\vec{x}_{1})-F_{inf}]}{\\eta T} + \\frac{2\\sigma^{2}}{\\sqrt{KT}} \\ = \\mathcal{O}(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{KT}}) $$\nHow to choose $\\tau$, $\\zeta$: for a small number of well-connected workers, larger $\\tau$ is more preferable; for a large number of workers, using a sparse mixing matrix and small $\\tau$ gives better convergence.\nEffect of Extreme Large $K$: the iteration number T will be extreme large.
