Less motor babbling from infants can lead to developmental delays. Our goal is to develop a socially assistive, non-contact, infant-robot interaction system to provide contingent positive feedback to increase exploration and expand early movement practice.\nTowards this end, we are collaborating with physical therapists to create approaches to predict the developmental status of infants using wearable sensors; running user studies that explore various robot rewards for contingent activities for the infant, as well as measuring the infant\u0026rsquo;s ability to mimic the robot; and using reinforcement learning to adjust the difficulty of the task presented by the robot to increase the infant\u0026rsquo;s engagement with the task.\nSee Interaction Lab website for details and related publications\n","date":1553583600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1553583600,"objectID":"4d1e0e9c7b1d701a2c5554b22de01a26","permalink":"/project/baby/","publishdate":"2019-03-26T00:00:00-07:00","relpermalink":"/project/baby/","section":"project","summary":"Our goal is to develop a socially assistive, non-contact, infant-robot interaction\nsystem to provide contingent positive feedback to increase exploration and expand\nearly movement practice\n","tags":["Computer Vision","Machine Learning","Robotics"],"title":"Infant-Robot Interaction as an Early Intervention Strategy","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Within the field of Human-Robot Interaction (HRI), a growing subfield is forming that focuses specifically on interactions between one or more robots and multiple people, known as Multi-Party Human-Robot Interaction (MP-HRI).
